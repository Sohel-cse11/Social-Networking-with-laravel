# Technology Used for this project

# Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is
 a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience
 to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of 
web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing 
tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly
 integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official
 Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
